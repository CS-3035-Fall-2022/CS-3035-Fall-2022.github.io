# Group Project - Video Presentation of Another Interface Building Technology

***Due: Nov. 3rd***

In a group, of four to five members, you will create a well-rehearsed and well-organized 8 minute video presenting an interface building technology other than one that uses Java, C#/XAML or one from another class you have taken (e.g., Unity, Android, etc). 

## Initial Action Items

 - You should have a group and a proposed technology/interface toolkit by Oct. 18th otherwise you will be assigned to a group in class

 - Once you have a group complete this form to register your group by Oct. 18th: [https://forms.office.com/r/zpMkYFjS6w]


## Requirements 

Your 8-minute video will cover:

 - An introductory title slide with the names of your group members and the name of the technology being presented. Shown on screen for approx 10 seconds. 

 - An introduction to the name of the language/technology and a brief overview of it's history (when was it developed, by whom and how did it evolve, etc.). approx. 30 seconds

 - An overview of the philosophy of the technology. What does it aim to do and why? What type of interfaces was it designed for? and/or what does it aim to do better than other languages/technologies? approx. 45-seconds to 1-minute

 - A quick overview of how an interface is built with the technology (do you use an interface builder? does use a compiled or interpreted language? is it provide a declarative or procedural method for defining the interface? what platforms does it work on? other important technological considerations?) approx. approx. 45-seconds to 1-minute

 - Fully demonstrate how a Hello World application is built using the technology. Explain what the commands do in the language. If it is really easy... provide some additional demonstration of the technology (e.g., add a button and event handling). approx 2-3 minutes. 

 - Does the language technology support applications that use an MVC architecture? Is it architecture independent or is it designed to support [another architecture](https://medium.com/@pinarkocak/mvc-mvp-and-mvvm-design-patterns-82317d6efeac) MVP, MVI, MVVM or VIPER... or something else!? Provide some explanation of how it supports a particular pattern. approx. 1 minute

 - Create a simple application that allows a user to play a game of paper rock, scissors using an appropriately designed interface. Demonstrate the game and provide a brief commentary on how difficult it was to create. Would it be easier in JavaFX? approx. 45 seconds

 - Conclusion: provide a brief subjective assessment of the language. Did your group like the language/technology. Do you think it would be easier or more difficult to build applications with than JavaFX? approx. 45 seconds

## Finding and Working in a Group

You may work with anyone in the class you like. Your group should have 4-5 members. Groups of other sizes will not be possible. You should have a group identified by Oct. 18. If you are not in a group by this time you must inform the instructor and you will be matched with a group during class time. 

Working in a group can be challenging. Ir is your responsibility that you stay in contact with your group and keep them informed of your availability and progress on tasks. 

## Choosing Technologies

A limit of two groups will be able to do a presentation of the same technology. This will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. 

You will need to confirm your choice of technology and register your group with the instructor by completing this form as soon as possible, but no later than Oct 18: [https://forms.office.com/r/zpMkYFjS6w]

Here are some examples of toolkit you might choose. Often interface toolkits have bindings for different languages. For example, Tk is often paired with tcl, Python, and Ruby. The language you use is up to you, but  it should be a language other than Java. 

For example Tk, FLTK, FOX Toolkit, GTK, CEGUI, Qt are good options and work with languages other than Java. 

More possibilities are listed on Wikipediaâ€™s list of [High-Level Widget Toolkits](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits). 

You may also propose a toolkit that is not listed here. You can suggest these, but have a secondary option available in the case the instructor determines the proposed toolkit is inappropriate. 


## Imagery and Videos

Your video presentation should include appropriate and professional use of images and other pre-recorded videos. 

## Timing

Your video should adhere to the strict 8-minute time limit. Suggested timings for each section are given, the specific timings for each requirement can fluctuate within reason. If your presentation is under 7-minutes you can likely say more about your technology. 

## How to create your video

 - Use Teams to create screen recordings of you demonstrating the building of a hello world app and paper, rock, scissors game 

 - Use PowerPoint to create a slideshow for your presentation 

 - PowerPoint allows you to crop your videos to get individual clips of the appropriate length

 - Rehearse your video with your group to make sure each part is of an appropriate length. Suggested timings are provided in the requirements above. Be sure to not go over the total 8 minute time limit. 
 
 - Have a Teams meeting with your group and record your presentation. Download your presentation and submit. 

 - You may wish to use an edit
 ing program to tweak or edit your video. This is totally optional and it is expected that Teams and PowerPoint will be sufficient for creating your video. 

## Grades

 - Grades will be awarded based on meeting the requirements above, with clarity and accuracy. 

 - A large portion of the grades will be based upon a subjective assessment of the quality and preparedness of the group. 

 - All group members should contribute as equally as possible to the presentation and a peer-assessment form may be given and used to scale your individual grade. 

## Submission

You should submit your group project by Friday. Yes, Friday, you get an extra day. 

 - Upload your video to Microsoft Stream. 

 - Set the video to be visible to everyone in my organization. 

 - Submit the link along with your team details to the link below:
